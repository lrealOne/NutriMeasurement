I started creating an object to get personal info:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e448675-8776-45d1-bdf8-ac8377340c65)


i use portuguese language but the information includes name, sex gender, age, weight, height, body mass index, goal, routine.


So, the next step was create a function that calculate the body mass index:

With these informations we got a lot of relevant information.


Function to get just valid names:

the object above get the "user taste" for some types of food.


So i did create a function that calculate initial basal metabolic rate:

the next step was make the conversion based on the practice of physical activity:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a952b20-e58b-482e-b597-268c42befe6f)
